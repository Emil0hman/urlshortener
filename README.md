# URLShortener
This is a not so secure url shortener with json files as a database

## Things I want to say:
- The design is not something I put much energy into
- Yes, I can just skip the `./l` folder and the AJAX req. in it, and just give the user a link to the PHP script
- This is just a proof of concept
- Yes, the security is cringeworthy

## Techstack
- JavaScript
- PHP
